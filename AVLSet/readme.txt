Assignmnet 3: AVLSet

How did you go about approaching this assignment?
I approached the assignment from minimum to plus. I work first on the minus version, then move to the check version, then move to the plus version. Lastly I come back through the whole assignment with a fine tooth comb, and make sure every requirement has been met. It's a multi-pass approach. I also work in a test first manner, so I write one test with expected behavior, then change the code to make the test pass, and then refactor the code to remove duplication. This process is repeated until I am satisfied I have implemented the assignment.

What works? What doesn't work?
I found it very difficult to implement the double rotations. This was difficult because I did not understand the rotations. I attmepted to use a test first approach, but coming up with expected results was impossible without first knowing how the rotation was supposed towork.

How did you test your implementation? Include testing results.

What problems did you encounter as you worked on this assignment?

What did you learn from this work? How will you approach the next programming assignment differently?



What are some ways to test the well-formedness of the input string for the Lukasiewicz methods?
